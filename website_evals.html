    <h1>Website Evaluations (Disliked)</h1>
    <h3>Website One</h3>
    <p><strong><a href="http://art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yale University School of Art</a></strong></p>
    <p>Evaluation:</p>
    <p>The website is very confusing to look at. The background is repeated over and over, do to <br />the fact the
        image is not correctly sized to be a background image. The colors are also a <br />bit hard to look at some being very
        bright while others being darker. It is very hard to<br /> navigate through the website and find what you are looking
        for exactly.</p>

    <h3>Website Two</h3>
    <p><strong><a href="http://www.theroommovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Room
                Movie</a></strong>
    </p>
    <p>Evaluation:</p>
    <p>The website itself is very informative I'll give them that but the repetition of words is quite <br /> annoying.
        The sizes of the words all different from each other so it is very hard for the <br /> website viewer to actually
        read the contents of the website. The structure of the website is <br /> also annoying to look at and hard to find
        what you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Website Three</h3>
    <p><strong><a href="https://paws.tcnj.edu/">PAWS</a></strong></p>
    <p>Evaluation:</p>
    <p>The school's student website is pretty outdated compared to other colleges' student <br>portals. It isn't the
        most pleasing website to look at and the text could be bigger for those <br> not able to see well. Finding what you
        are looking for also isn't very hard, but it could be <br> much easier.</p>
