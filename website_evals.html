<h1>Website Evaluation</h1>
<h3>Website One</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://art.yale.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yale University School of Art</a></strong></p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>The website is very confusing to look at. The background is repeated over and over, do to <br />the fact the image is not correctly sized to be a background image. The colors are also a <br />bit hard to look at some being very bright while others being darker. It is very hard to<br /> navigate through the website and find what you are looking for exactly.</p>

<h3>Website Two</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.theroommovie.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Room Movie</a></strong></p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>The website itself is very informative I'll give them that but the repetition of words is quite <br> annoying. The sizes of the words all different from each other so it is very hard for the <br> website viewer to actually read the contents of the website. The structure of the website is <br> also annoying to look at and hard to find what you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>
