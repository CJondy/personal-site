<h1>Three Websites</h1>

<h3>Website One</h3>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.roblox.com/home">Roblox</a></p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>A few things I like about this website is, one the header bar menu, I'd like to learn more<br>on how to create and design one for my own websites. The overall structure of the website <br> I find to be unlike other game websites I have see before. The ads I can go without.</p>

<h3>Website Two</h3>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>The structure of the website is intersting. Split up into three seperate blocks, each have <br> there own information. The left one with a list of links to other parts of the website, <br> the middle one with the activity feed of your facebook friends and ads. And the right  <br> block has even more ads.</p>

<h3>Website Three</h3>
<p>URL: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a></p>
<p>Evaluation:</p>
<p>What I like about this website is the horizontal scrolling images at the top part of the page. <br>it gives ads for the website itself and items you may want to buy. The homepage is split <br> up to many small blocks with many different items as well as videos and ads.</p>
