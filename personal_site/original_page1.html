    <h2>Track &amp; Field</h2>
    <p>My career as a Track &amp; Field athlete started back in my sophomore year of high school, where are soon came to realize it would be something that made me truly happy and very much enjoyed doing. Being a Track athlete is simple to explain but executed it is much more difficult.</p>

    <p>I am a short sprinter which includes events such as the 55m, 60m, 100m, and 200m dash. Being a shorter sprinter has its perks like being done will a race in literally seconds while distance runner may have races that last over ten minutes. The 100m is one of the most popular and well-known events in the world of Track &amp; Field thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt">Usain Bolt</a> who made a huge impact in media when he broke the world record in 2009 with a time of 9.58.</p>

    <p>I am currently a Track athlete here at The College of New Jersey and like I previously stated I am a short sprinter. There are other events I have been apart of in the past that I am interested in one day going back to these events as they were really fun and entertaining to do such as long and triple jump.</p>
